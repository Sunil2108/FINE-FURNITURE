             <pre>This website is used to develop our industry which was since in 1990, At Gulmohar Lane, we take great pride in design and  hand-craftsmanship of our products. 
                  Our in-house designers create time honed designs. The expert craftsmen, some of them even from the fourth generations of furniture and sofa karigars, who have been 
                  working for the Royalty in Rajasthan, transform these designs into timeless products. Our designs blend contemporary sensibilities with traditions of excellence in 
                  craftsmanship and quality. Our products whether a Sofa, a Chair, a Coffee table or Soft furnishings are made in India to the most exacting standards and designed in styles, 
                  so that they bring exceptional beauty to your home. 
                  Gulmohar Lane is co-founded by Saurabh Ailawadi and Shweta Mewara, with varied experience in the field of design, interiors, retail and brand management.
                  We at Gulmohar Lane believe that your home should be your haven, where you dine, work, sleep, dream and live. The brand should inspire you to make a home that reflects your
                  personality and your aesthetics. Your home should be the most comfortable place for you and it is rightly said that the things we love always tell a story and reflect who we are.  
                  Our passion for creating and providing furniture options that breathe easy and exude strong aesthetics comes from the gap we saw in the Indian market. It is a daunting task to find 
                  a sofa or a piece of furniture that could provide you comfort, beauty and priced fairly all at the same time . In the current scenario either you get options which are over-the-top pieces 
                  made in ply-board or cheap quality wood which are wrapped in synthetic polyester fabrics or you find ‘Made in the East’ rubber-wood furniture which cannot even last a year to reveal the shoddy quality.  
                  If you are lucky to find something good, the price tag would hold you back.
